Steps to remove a worker node of an OpenShift 4 cluster on https://www.exoscale.com[Exoscale] which uses instance pools.
--

== Starting situation

* You already have a OpenShift 4 cluster on Exoscale
* Your cluster uses instance pools for the worker and infra nodes
* You have admin-level access to the cluster
* You want to remove an existing worker node in the cluster

== High-level overview

* Drain the node
* Then we remove it from Kubernetes.
* Finally we remove the associated VM from the instance pool.

== Prerequisites

== Prepare local environment

== Prepare Terraform environment

== Drain and Remove Node

* Select a node to remove.
With instance pools, we can remove any node.
+
[source,bash]
----
export NODE_TO_REMOVE=<node name>
----

* If you are working on a production cluster, you need to *schedule the node drain for the next maintenance.*
* If you are working on a non-production cluster, you may *drain and remove the node immediately.*

=== Schedule node drain (production clusters)

=== Drain and remove node immediately

== Update Cluster Config

. Update cluster config.
+
[source,bash]
----
pushd "inventory/classes/${TENANT_ID}/"

yq eval -i ".parameters.openshift4_terraform.terraform_variables.worker_count -= 1" \
  ${CLUSTER_ID}.yml
----

. Review and commit
+
[source,bash]
----

# Have a look at the file ${CLUSTER_ID}.yml.

git commit -a -m "Remove worker node from cluster ${CLUSTER_ID}"
git push

popd
----

. Compile and push cluster catalog
+
[source,bash]
----
commodore catalog compile ${CLUSTER_ID} --push -i
----
