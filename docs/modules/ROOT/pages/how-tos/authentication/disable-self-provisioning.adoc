= Disable project self-provisioning on OpenShift 4

[abstract]
This guide describes how to remove permission for users to self-provision projects on OpenShift 4 clusters.
It's based on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/applications/projects/configuring-project-creation.html#disabling-project-self-provisioning_configuring-project-creation[this OpenShift documentation].

== Prerequisites

* Access to the respective cluster's tenant repository.

== Procedure

To disable self-provisioning, patch the `self-provisioners` CRB with the following `Patch` (for example via adhoc-configurations):

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Patch
metadata:
  name: self-provisioning
spec:
  patches:
    self-provisioning-patch:
      patchTemplate: '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/subjects", "value": null}]'
      patchType: application/json-patch+json
      targetObjectRef:
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRoleBinding
        name: self-provisioners
----

Roll out this patch and verify it applies. This disables self-provisioning for general authenticated users.
