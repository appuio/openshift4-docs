For the following steps, change into a clean directory (for example a directory in your home).

[CAUTION]
These are the only steps which aren't idempotent and have to be completed uninterrupted in one go.
If you have to recreate the install config or any of the generated manifests you need to rerun all of the subsequent steps.

[NOTE]
--
You can add more options to the `install-config.yaml` file.
Have a look at the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp-minor-version}/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-bare-metal-config-yaml_installing-bare-metal[config example] for more information.

For example, you could change the SDN from a default value to something a customer requests due to some network requirements.
