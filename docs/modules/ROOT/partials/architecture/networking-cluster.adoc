Each APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 cluster is deployed into a /24 "cluster machine network" (sometimes also "cluster network" or "machine network")
This network must be provided by the {infra-type} infrastructure operator.
DHCP is mandatory for this network, but a number of IPs must be reserved to be used as Virtual IPs for the cluster.

Traffic inside this network shouldn't be restricted.

VMs in this network must be able to reach various services on the internet.
See below for a detailed list of external systems that must be reachable.
