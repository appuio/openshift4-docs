= Become Cluster Admin

See the xref:explanations/sudo.adoc[] for a background explanation.


== CLI Usage

To elevate privileges to cluster-admin using the `oc` or `kubectl` CLI, specify the https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl[`--as=system:admin`] flag:

[source,console]
----
oc --as=system:admin get nodes
----

This will impersonate the stated user for this command.

=== Usage in tools that use the kubeconfig file

The `kubeconfig` file has a `users` section where impersonation can be https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeconfig.v1/#AuthInfo[configured].

The file can be found at `$HOME/.kube/config` or at the location specified by the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.

[source,bash]
----
# Impersonation config for current context
yq -i '.current-context as $cc | (.contexts[] | select(.name == $cc) | .context.user) as $cu | with(.users[] | select(.name == $cu); .user.as = "system:admin")' ${KUBECONFIG:-$HOME/.kube/config}
oc whoami

# Use your tool of choice ...

# Stop impersonation
yq -i '.current-context as $cc | (.contexts[] | select(.name == $cc) | .context.user) as $cu | with(.users[] | select(.name == $cu); del(.user.as))' ${KUBECONFIG:-$HOME/.kube/config}
oc whoami
