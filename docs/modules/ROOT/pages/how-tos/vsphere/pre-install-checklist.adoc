= Pre-Installation Checklist for OpenShift 4 on VMware vSphere

[abstract]
This checklist should help in getting everything ready for a smooth installation of OpenShift 4 on VMware vSphere.

== Checklist

[options="interactive"]
* [ ] <<VMware vSphere,VM template>> ready?
* [ ] <<Virtual Machines,VMs>> created?
* [ ] Webserver for ignition files ready (check the https://www.openshift.com/blog/openshift-4-2-vsphere-install-quickstart[OpenShift Documentation] for an example)?
* [ ] <<Address and DHCP,DHCP>> scope with reservations configured?
* [ ] <<DNS records>> created?
* [ ] <<Certificates>> created?
* [ ] <<Load balancers>> ready?
* [ ] <<Communication,Firewall>> and <<Outgoing proxy,proxy>> rules created?

== VMware vSphere

* For the OpenShift vSphere integration and vSphere CSI Driver to work, vSphere must be at version 7.0 U2 or later.
* A VM "template" based on the https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.4/latest/[Red Hat CoreOS image] is required, which is explained in https://blog.openshift.com/openshift-4-2-vsphere-install-quickstart/[this blog post].
* The vSphere folder name, which contains all VMs of an OpenShift cluster, must match the cluster name that you specified in the `install-config.yaml` file.
* The account used to connect to the vCenter must at least have the roles and permissions described at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5655791[What are the minimum privileges required to install Openshift IPI in a vSphere environment] and https://vsphere-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/driver-deployment/prerequisites.html#vsphere-roles-and-privileges-[vSphere CSI Driver - Prerequisites - Roles and Privileges ].

== Virtual Machines

The following VMs are required to create an OpenShift 4 cluster:

|===
|Machine |Number |vCPU |RAM |Storage |OS

|Bastion Host<<fn1,^1^>> |1 |1 |4 GB |20 GB |RHEL or similar

|Webserver<<fn1,^1^>> |1 |1 |4 GB |20 GB |irrelevant

|Bootstrap Node<<fn2,^2^>> |1 |4 |16 GB |120 GB |RHCOS<<fn4,^4^>>

|Masters |3 |4 |16 GB |120 GB |RHCOS<<fn4,^4^>>

|Infra Nodes |3 |8 |32 GB |120 GB |RHCOS<<fn4,^4^>>

|Worker Nodes<<fn3,^3^>> |2+ |2+ |8+ GB |120 GB |RHCOS<<fn4,^4^>>
|===

[[fn1]]^1^: The bastion host can also be used as a web server. Red Hat doesn't define any resource requirements for bastion host and web server. The values above are based on our recommendations and can be adapted to your needs.

[[fn2]]^2^: The bootstrap node is a temporary machine that can be deleted after the installation.

[[fn3]]^3^: Number and dimensioning of the worker nodes is dependent on your workload.

[[fn4]]^4^: RHCOS = Red Hat CoreOS

== Network

=== Address and DHCP

The OpenShift VMs should get their IP address via DHCP. Create DHCP reservations with the specified MAC address of the VM.

=== DNS records

Several DNS records are required for OpenShift to work correctly.

The https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-network-customizations.html#installation-dns-user-infra_installing-vsphere-network-customizations[OpenShift documentation] lists the required records in detail.

To illustrate, the following variables are set:

[horizontal]
`<base_domain>:`:: `appuio.ch`
`<cluster_name>:`:: `ocp4-vs`

[CAUTION]
====
`<cluster_name>` must match the folder name in vSphere, in which all OpenShift VMs reside, for vSphere storage integration to work correctly.
====

With the defined variables, the following DNS records are required:

|===
|Record |Type |Target 

|`api.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` |A/CNAME |API Load Balancer

|`api-int.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` |A/CNAME |API Load Balancer

|`*.apps.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` |A/CNAME |Apps Load Balancer

|`console.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` |CNAME |Apps Load Balancer

|`etcd-0.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` |A |Master 1

|`etcd-1.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` |A |Master 2

|`etcd-2.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` |A |Master 3

|`_etcd-server-ssl._tcp.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` |SRV |See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-network-customizations.html#installation-dns-user-infra_installing-vsphere-network-customizations[User-provisioned DNS requirements] for details.
|===

[WARNING]
====
By default, Windows DNS servers create a SRV record for every A record.
For the A records of `etcd`, make sure that the SRV records aren't created (or delete them, if they were), so the hostnames can be enumerated correctly.
====

=== Certificates

Certificates for the following hostnames need to be created:

* `api.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch`
* `console.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch`
* `*.apps.ocp4-vs.appuio.ch` (wildcard certificate)

[IMPORTANT]
.Subject Alternative Name
====
For the certificates to be valid in modern web browser, make sure the _Subject Alternative Name (SAN)_ contains the hostname of the certificate.
See https://www.switch.ch/pki/manage/request/csr-openssl/[How to create a CSR with OpenSSL] for an example on how to do so.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Private PKI
[[private-pki]]
====
If the certificates are issued from your own private PKI, the RootCA certificate of your PKI needs to be added to the `install-config.yaml` as described in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/configuring-a-custom-pki.html#installation-configure-proxy_configuring-a-custom-pki[Configuring a custom PKI]:
[source,bash]
----
…
additionalTrustBundle: | 
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT_1>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT_2>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
…
----
Multiple CA certificates can be added.
====

=== Load balancers

For accessing API and applications, the following load balancers are required:

* API load balancer
  ** Targets: all 3 masters and the bootstrap node at the beginning of the installation
  ** Ports: 6443/tcp, 22623/tcp
  ** TLS passthrough (no TLS termination on the load balancer
  ** WebSockets allowed
* Apps load balancer
  ** Targets: all 3 Infra Nodes
  ** Ports: 80/tcp, 443/tcp
  ** TLS passthrough (optimally no TLS termination on the load balancer)

=== Communication

The following communication has to be guaranteed:

|===
|Source |Destination |Ports |Comment

|OpenShift |API load balancer |6443/tcp, 22623/tcp |All nodes

|OpenShift |App load balancer |80/tcp, 443/tcp |All nodes

|OpenShift |Outgoing proxy |depending on proxy |All nodes

|OpenShift masters |Configured IdP |depending on IdP |Authentication is handled by components running on masters
|===

Possible further surrounding systems:

* Access to Git repositories from all worker nodes
* Access to databases and other applications from all worker nodes

=== Outgoing proxy

The following URLs need to be whitelisted on the outgoing proxy, as described at https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.html[Configuring your firewall].

If the connection to the proxy is done via HTTPS, the CA certificate, which was used to sign the certificate of the proxy server, needs to be added to the `install-config.yaml`, as described <<private-pki,above>>.

See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.html#installation-configure-proxy_installing-vsphere[Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation] for details.
