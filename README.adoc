== Documentation structure

The documentation structure is inspired by the https://documentation.divio.com/[Divio's documentation structure]:

Tutorials (Learning-oriented):: A lesson which teaches you something.
Location: `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/tutorials`.

How-to guides (Problem-oriented):: Step-by-step guides to achieve a goal. Location: `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/how-tos`.

Technical reference (Information-oriented):: Description about the inner ongoings. Location: `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/tutorials`.

Explanation (Understanding-oriented):: Explains the background. Location: `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/explanations`.

== Contributing

Create a new branch to make the changes. After you're satisfied with the changes open a Pull Request against the `master` branch.

=== Previewing Changes

To preview your changes locally, make sure you have Docker or Podman installed.

Just type `make preview` and open your browser at http://localhost:2020. This even provides support for live reload when working on the content. See https://github.com/vshn/antora-preview#livereload[this documentation] for more information about it.

=== Adding a New Page

. Create new AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) file in the best matching folder according to the described structure under `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/`.
. Add the file to the navigation under `docs/modules/ROOT/partials/`

For removing pages just do the opposite: Remove the file and remove the entry in the navigation.

== Deployment

This repository only holds https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/standard-directories/[Antora content], no plumbing and tooling (aka the Antora https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/run-antora/[`playbook.yml`] and `Dockerfile`) to build and deploy it.
All pushes to the `master` branch trigger a GitHub action (`.github/worflows/triggerci.yml`) which in turn triggers the https://git.vshn.net/vshn/docs/kb/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml[GitLab CI job] to build and deploy the content using Antora.
