. Evict the VM(s) from the instance pool
+
[NOTE]
====
We're going through all {instance-pool-group} instance pools to find the pool containing the node(s) to remove.
This ensures that we can apply the step as-is on clusters on dedicated hypervisors which may have multiple {instance-pool-group} instance pools.

. Run Terraform to update the state with the new instance pool size
+
NOTE: There shouldn't be any changes since `instance-pool evict` reduces the instance-pool size by one.
+
NOTE: Ensure that you're still in directory `${WORK_DIR}/catalog/manifests/openshift4-terraform` before executing this command.
