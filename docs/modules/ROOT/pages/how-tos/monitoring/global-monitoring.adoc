== Overview

VSHN hosts a global monitoring instance for all APPUiO managed OCP4 clusters.
This instance is available at https://insights.appuio.net/.

The global monitoring is currently exclusively used for SLO monitoring.

An APPUiO managed OCP4 cluster with VSHN defaults will start sending data to this instance as soon as the `openshift4-slos` component is installed.

There is an overview dashboard available at https://insights.appuio.net/d/high-level-sloth-slos/high-level-sloth-slos and a detailed, per cluster dashboard available at https://insights.appuio.net/d/slo-detail/detailed-sloth-slos.

=== Changes to the dashboards

Users with the `Openshiftroot` role are able to change the dashboards.
Please notify https://vshn.chat/channel/tarazed[Team Tarazed] if you want to make changes to the dashboards in the Tarazed folder.
