[CAUTION]
The steps in this section aren't idempotent and have to be completed uninterrupted in one go.
If you have to recreate the install config or any of the generated manifests you need to rerun all of the subsequent steps.

. Render install manifests (this will consume the `install-config.yaml`)
+
[source,bash]
----
openshift-install --dir "${INSTALLER_DIR}" \
  create manifests
----

.. If you want to change the default "apps" domain for the cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
yq w -i "${INSTALLER_DIR}/manifests/cluster-ingress-02-config.yml" \
  spec.domain apps.example.com
----

. Copy pre-rendered Cilium manifests
+
[source,bash]
----
cp catalog/manifests/cilium/olm/* target/manifests/
----

. Extract the cluster domain from the generated manifests
+
[source,bash]
----
export CLUSTER_DOMAIN=$(yq e '.spec.baseDomain' \
  "${INSTALLER_DIR}/manifests/cluster-dns-02-config.yml")
----

. Prepare install manifests and ignition config
+
[source,bash]
----
openshift-install --dir "${INSTALLER_DIR}" \
  create ignition-configs
----
