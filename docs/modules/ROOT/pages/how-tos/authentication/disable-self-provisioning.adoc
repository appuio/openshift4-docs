= Disable project self-provisioning on OpenShift 4

[abstract]
This guide describes how to remove permission for users to self-provision projects on OpenShift 4 clusters.
It's based on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/applications/projects/configuring-project-creation.html#disabling-project-self-provisioning_configuring-project-creation[this OpenShift documentation].

[NOTE]
====
The self-provisioners can also be managed by the https://hub.syn.tools/openshift4-authentication/references/parameters.html[openshift4-authentication] component.
====

== Prerequisites

* Access to the respective cluster's tenant repository.

== Procedure

To disable self-provisioning, patch the `self-provisioners` CRB with the following `ManagedResource` (for example via adhoc-configurations):

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: remove-self-provisioning
  namespace: syn-espejote
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: remove-self-provisioning
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
      - project.openshift.io
    resources:
      - projectrequests
    verbs:
      - create
  - apiGroups:
      - rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    resourceNames:
      - self-provisioners
    resources:
      - clusterrolebindings
    verbs:
      - '*'
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: remove-self-provisioning
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: remove-self-provisioning
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: remove-self-provisioning
    namespace: syn-espejote
---
apiVersion: espejote.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedResource
metadata:
  name: remove-self-provisioning
  namespace: syn-espejote
spec:
  applyOptions:
    force: true
  serviceAccountRef:
    name: remove-self-provisioning
  template: |-
    {
        "apiVersion": "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1",
        "kind": "ClusterRoleBinding",
        "metadata": {
            "name": "self-provisioners"
        },
        "subjects": []
    }
  triggers:
    - name: clusterrolebinding
      watchResource:
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRoleBinding
        name: self-provisioners
----

Roll out this patch and verify it applies. This disables self-provisioning for general authenticated users.
