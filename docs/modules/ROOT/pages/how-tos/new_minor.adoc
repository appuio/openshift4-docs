= Checklist to prepare for new minor version OpenShift 4

. Conduct upgrade
+
Use an existing test cluster and upgrade it to the new version.
+
[NOTE]
====
The new minor might not show up in the list of available updates even when setting the channel accordingly.
If this is the case, set the clusters update channel to `fast-<n-1>` and update to the latest patch first.
This is, amongst others, nessesary, when there is no GA release for the new minor available yet.
The first GA version of a new minor usually is `4.<n>.3`.

[TIP]
====
Instead of using an existing cluster, you can also set up one with version `4.<n-1>` and then upgrade this one.

. Check compatibility of components
. Conduct install on all supported cloud providers
