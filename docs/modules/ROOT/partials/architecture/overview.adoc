The APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 architecture on {infra-type} is based on the xref:references/architecture/index.adoc[generic APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 architecture].
We expect that readers of this document are familiar with the xref:references/architecture/index.adoc[generic APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 architecture] and the overall Kubernetes and OpenShift 4 architecture.

This architecture document extends upon the generic architecture by defining how the APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 cluster is embedded into the {infra-type} environment.
The diagram below shows a detailed view of how an APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 cluster is embedded into the {infra-type} environment.
