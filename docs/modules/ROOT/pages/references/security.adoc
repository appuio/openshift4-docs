== Access Management

=== Long Lived Tokens

The default OpenShift 10 year emergency admin token is disabled and replaced by a short lived token.

See xref:oc4:ROOT:references/architecture/emergency_credentials.adoc[].

=== Two Factor Authentication

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters are configured to use two factor authentication through https://kb.vshn.ch/kb/vshn-login.html[VSHN Login] for the web console by default.
The OpenID client configuration is centrally managed according to best practices.

See xref:oc4:ROOT:references/architecture/single_sign_on.adoc[].

=== Sudo

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters are configured to deny dangerous operations by default.

See xref:oc4:ROOT:explanations/sudo.adoc[].

== Privileged Containers and Build Strategies

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters are configured to deny the use of privileged containers and build strategies by default.

=== OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters run workloads with OpenShift's `restricted-v2` SCC by default.

--
The `restricted-v2` SCC:

* Ensures that pods cannot run as privileged
* Ensures that pods cannot mount host directory volumes
* Requires that a pod is run as a user in a pre-allocated range of UIDs
* Requires that a pod is run with a pre-allocated MCS label
* Requires that a pod is run with a preallocated FSGroup
* Allows pods to use any supplemental group
* ALL capabilities are dropped from containers.
* The `NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability can be added explicitly.
* `seccompProfile` is set to `runtime/default` by default.
* `allowPrivilegeEscalation` must be unset or set to `false` in security contexts

==== Seccomp

CRI-Os seccomp profile `runtime/default` restricts syscalls that can be used to shorten exploit chains.

=== Kubernetes Pod Security Admission

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters are configured to validate workloads against the `restricted` Kubernetes Pod Security Standard by default.
Currently, the Pod Security Admission is configured to only warn users about violating configurations.

See xref:oc4:ROOT:explanations/pod_security.adoc[] for details on how PSA and OpenShift SCCs interact.

== Network

=== Load Balancer

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters include, depending on the cloud provider, hardened load balancers based on HAProxy.

Additional firewalls and jump hosts can be configured on request.

=== Cilium

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters uses the hardened enterprise version of Cilium as the default network plugin.

See https://products.vshn.ch/openshift/cilium.html[VSHN Products: Isovalent Enterprise for Cilium] and https://cilium.io/[Cilium].

=== Default Namespace Isolation

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters are configured to deny traffic between namespaces by default.

=== OpenShift Service Mesh

VSHN Managed OpenShift can use a hardened version of Istio as the default service mesh.

See https://docs.appuio.ch/managed-openshift/openshift-service-mesh/index.html[VSHN Managed OpenShift for End-Users: OpenShift Service Mesh].

== Updates

All VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters and their load balancers are automatically updated to the latest version of OpenShift and the latest security patches.
If not otherwise agreed, the updates are applied weekly during the communicated maintenance window.

See xref:oc4:ROOT:references/architecture/upgrade_controller.adoc[].

== Backup

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters include backups of all Kubernetes manifests and the raw etcd data to a secure location by default.

* xref:oc4:ROOT:explanations/disaster_recovery.adoc[]
* xref:oc4:ROOT:how-tos/recover-from-backup.adoc[]

== Inventory

All VSHN managed configuration and software for the OpenShift clusters are stored in a central Git repository.
Software versions are reported in a central repository and actively monitored.

We use https://syn.tools/syn/index.html[Project Syn] to manage the inventory.

=== Staggered Rollouts

New software versions are rolled out in a staggered manner to ensure that the software is stable and secure.

== Monitoring and Logging

See https://kb.vshn.ch/corp-tech/centralinsights/index.html[Central Insights] for more information.

=== Capacity Monitoring

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters include capacity monitoring by default.
VSHN gets notified if the cluster is running out of resources.

See xref:oc4:ROOT:explanations/cluster_monitoring.adoc[]

=== Logging

VSHN Managed OpenShift clusters include logging by default.
The log management is done by the OpenShift cluster itself.
It's based on Loki and integrated into the OpenShift console.

Also see https://docs.appuio.ch/managed-openshift/logging/howto-query-logs.html[VSHN Managed OpenShift for End-Users: Query application logs].

A copy of the Kubernetes audit logs is stored in a secure location at VSHN.

== Deletion

Robust, tested, and audited deletion processes are in place to ensure that all data is securely deleted when no longer needed.
