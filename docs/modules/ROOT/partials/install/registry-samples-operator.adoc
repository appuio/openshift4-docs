[NOTE]
====
If the registry S3 credentials are created too long after the initial cluster setup, it's possible that the `openshift-samples` operator has disabled itself because it couldn't find a working in-cluster registry.

If the samples operator is disabled, no templates and builder images will be available on the cluster.

You can check the samples-operator's state with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get config.samples cluster -ojsonpath='{.spec.managementState}'
----

If the command returns `Removed`, verify that the in-cluster registry pods are now running, and enable the samples operator again:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl patch config.samples cluster -p '{"spec":{"managementState":"Managed"}}'
----

See the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/configuring-samples-operator.html[upstream documentation] for more details on the samples operator.
