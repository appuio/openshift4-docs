The {infra-type} infrastructure operator must provide some form of ingress and egress gateway for the cluster.
The ingress gateway must expose two public IPs:

1. A public IP for the API.
Traffic to port `6443/tcp` on this IP must be forwarded to the "API VIP" in the machine network.
The forwarding of this traffic must happen transparently.
In particular, no TLS interception can be performed as the Kubernetes API depends on mutual TLS authentication.
VSHN will manage a DNS record pointing to this IP.
2. A public IP for HTTP(s) ingress.
Traffic to ports `80/tcp` and `443/tcp` on this IP must be forwarded to the "Ingress VIP" in the machine network.
The PROXY protocol should be enabled to preserve source IPs.
Forwarding should happen transparently in TCP mode.
VSHN will manage a wildcard DNS record pointing to this IP.
Additional DNS records can be pointed to this IP by the customer.

ifeval::["{infra-type}" == "OpenStack"]
NOTE: The ingress gateway isn't required if the OpenShift cluster's API and ingress are exposed directly on OpenStack floating IPs which are public IPs.
