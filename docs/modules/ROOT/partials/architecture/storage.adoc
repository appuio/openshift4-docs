APPUiO managed OpenShift 4 requires 3 different types of storage:

1. Root disks
2. Persistent volumes
3. S3 compatible object storage

=== Root disks

Root disks are virtual block devices (100 GiB) which are attached to the VMs which make up the APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 cluster.
The root disks are allocated and attached to the VM when the VM is created.
They hold the operating system and temporary data.
They're ephemeral (no application data is stored on them), and don't need to be backed up.
Finally, root disks are deleted when the VM to which they're attached is deleted.

=== Persistent volumes

Persistent volumes are virtual block devices with arbitrary sizes.
They're allocated dynamically based on requests from workloads (applications or infrastructure components) within the cluster.
These block devices are automatically attached to the VM hosting the application container.
They're deleted when the corresponding Kubernetes `PersistentVolume` resource is deleted.

The {infra-type} CSI driver is the in-cluster component which is responsible for allocating, attaching and deleting the persistent volume block devices.

These devices hold application data, but backups are usually done from within the cluster.

=== S3 compatible object storage

Various OpenShift components, such as the integrated image registry, the logging stack and backups, require S3 compatible object storage.
The customer or vSphere infrastructure operator must provide S3 compatible object storage.
Most modern storage solutions offer some object storage functionality.

If https://products.vshn.ch/appcat/index.html[VSHN's Application Catalog (AppCat)] offering is required on the cluster, the object storage must support automatic bucket creation via an AppCat-supported provisioner.

NOTE: If no object storage is available, we can use external object storage as a fallback.
