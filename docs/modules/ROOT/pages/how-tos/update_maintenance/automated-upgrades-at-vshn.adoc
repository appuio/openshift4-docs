= Automated Upgrades at VSHN

[IMPORTANT]
====
This page is VSHN-specific and uses VSHN configuration.

To implement your own automated upgrades, please take a look at the underlying https://hub.syn.tools/openshift-upgrade-controller/references/parameters.html#_upgrade_configs[components documentation].
====

VSHN has predefined maintenance schedules defined for OpenShift clusters.
The schedules are defined in the global defaults and can be chosen on a per-cluster basis.
The schedules are set with the `maintenance_window` Lieutenant cluster fact.

. Select a schedule from https://git.vshn.net/syn/commodore-defaults/-/tree/master/distribution/openshift4/managed-upgrade-schedules[distribution/openshift4/managed-upgrade-schedules].

. Set it as `maintenance_window` fact in https://control.vshn.net/syn/lieutenantclusters[control.vshn.net].
