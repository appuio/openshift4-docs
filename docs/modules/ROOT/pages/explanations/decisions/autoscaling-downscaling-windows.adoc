= Autoscaling with Restricted Downscaling

== Problem

OpenShift 4 provides two custom resources to control the autoscaling behavior of a cluster: `ClusterAutoscaler` and `MachineAutoscaler`.
To get any autoscaling at all, a `ClusterAutoscaler` resource must be configured.
The `ClusterAutoscaler` resource provides global limits to autoscaling.
Additionally, the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource provides some knobs to tune the scaling behavior.

To actually enable autoscaling, one or more `MachineAutoscaler` resources need to be configured as well.
Each `MachineAutoscaler` resource configures autoscaling for a single `MachineSet`.

By default, the OpenShift cluster autoscaling only allows users to enable or disable downscaling. by setting field `spec.scaleDown.enabled` on the `ClusterAutosclaer` resource.

By default, VSHN Managed OpenShift 4 will scale down unused nodes at any time.
The node(s) which are scaled down are selected based on their current utilization when the overall cluster utilization falls below a configurable threshold.

However, we expect that some of our customers will require more restricted downscaling to avoid any end-user visible impact to their applications when nodes are drained and scaled down.

== Goals

* Determine a suitable option to dynamically enable downscaling through the default OpenShift `ClusterAutoscaler` and `MachineAutoscaler` custom resource

== Non-Goals

* Introduce a custom cluster autoscaler architecture

== Proposals

=== Downscaling at any time

[#downscaling-clusterautoscaler]
=== Control downscaling by adjusting the `ClusterAutoscaler` configuration

The first option to restrict the downscaling of the cluster is to dynamically manage the `ClusterAutoscaler`'s field `spec.downScale.enabled`.
By setting this field to `true` only for certain time windows, we can ensure that nodes are only scaled down during those time windows.

==== Downscaling only in maintenance window

The first variant for this approach restricts scaling down of nodes to the clusterâ€™s regular maintenance window.
This can be implemented through two xref:oc4:ROOT:references/architecture/upgrade_controller.adoc#_upgradejobhook[upgrade hooks]: one which sets `spec.scaleDown.enabled=true` at the start of the maintenance, and one which sets `spec.scaleDown.enabled=false` at the end of the maintenance.
Additionally, this variant will require a customized ArgoCD sync for the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource to ensure that ArgoCD doesn't revert the change to `spec.scaleDown.enabled` during the maintenance.

==== Downscaling in custom time windows

The second variant requires a custom controller which manages the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource to set `spec.scaleDown.enabled` based on a set of time windows.
Having a controller which manages the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource allows more flexible downscaling windows, such as every workday night from 20:00 to 07:00.
However, this variant requires a significant amount of engineering, since we'll need to design and implement a new controller which manages the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource.

Notably, this variant will introduce a new custom resource (for example `ClusterAutoscalerConfiguration`) which will be used to specify the base configuration of the `ClusterAutoscaler` and a list of time windows in which downscaling should be enabled.
For this variant, the exact design will need to be documented in a separate page in this documentation.

[#downscaling-machineautoscaler]
=== Control downscaling by adjusting the `MachineAutoscaler` configuration


The second option to restrict downscaling of the cluster is to dynamically update `spec.minReplicas` of each `MachineAutoscaler` resource whenever the cluster autoscaler scales up the referenced `MachineSet` and to revert `spec.minReplicas` to the desired minimum size of the `MachineSet` during the downscaling window.
For this approach `spec.scaleDown.enabled` would be unconditionally set to `true` in the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource.

This approach requires a controller which manages the `MachineAutoscaler` resources and updates them whenever it sees that a `MachineSet` is scaled up.
For this approach, the exact design will need to be documented in a separate page in this documentation.

== Decision

We've decided to <<downscaling-clusterautoscaler,control downscaling by adjusting the `ClusterAutoscaler` configuration>>.

To start, we'll only support the variant where nodes are only downscaled during the cluster's maintenance window.

== Rationale

The approach where we manage `spec.scaleDown.enabled` of the `ClusterAutoscaler` resource allows us to offer some control over downscaling without having to design and implement an additional controller.
This allows us to provide some autoscaling to customers whose workloads are sensitive to disruptions during normal cluster operations.
Notably, there's a chance that no nodes will ever be scaled down depending on the usage patterns that cause the scale up.

In the future, if a customer has more complex requirements and is willing to cover a part of the implementation effort, we can easily migrate to the variant which offers arbitrary downscaling windows through a custom controller.
