= Automated Upgrades at VSHN

[IMPORTANT]
====
This page is VSHN specific and uses VSHN configuration.

To implement your own automated upgrades, please refer to the underlying https://hub.syn.tools/openshift-upgrade-controller/references/parameters.html#_upgrade_configs[components documentation].
====

VSHN has predefined maintenance schedules defined for OpenShift clusters.
The schedules are defined in the global defaults and can be chosen on a per-cluster basis.

. Select a schedule from https://git.vshn.net/syn/commodore-defaults/-/tree/master/distribution/openshift4/managed-upgrade-schedules[distribution/openshift4/managed-upgrade-schedules].

. Add the schedule to the cluster's `CLUSTER_ID.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
classes:
 - global.distribution.openshift4.managed-upgrade-schedules.monday-afternoon
----

. Commit and push the changes.

. Mark the cluster as auto-upgrading in the maintenance log https://wiki.vshn.net/display/VT/How+to+Edit+Maintenance+Log+Template.
