[NOTE]
====
The steps in this section must be run on a host which can reach the {provider-display} API.
If you can't reach the {provider-display} API directly, but a SSH jumphost is available, you can setup a SOCKS5 proxy with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
export JUMPHOST_FQDN=<jumphost fqdn or alias from your SSH config> <1>
ssh -D 12000 -q -f -N ${JUMPHOST_FQDN} <2>
export https_proxy=socks5://localhost:12000 <3>
export CURL_OPTS="-xsocks5h://localhost:12000"
----
<1> The FQDN or SSH alias of the host which can reach the {provider-display} API
<2> This command expects that your SSH config is setup so that `ssh ${JUMPHOST_FQDN}` works without further configuration
<3> The `openshift-install` tool respects the `https_proxy` environment variable
