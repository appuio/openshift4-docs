= Change vSphere parameters

[abstract]
This checklist should help in changing the parameters in all places necessary.

Example scenario: The Datacenter was renamed in vSphere.

== Checlist

[options="interactive"]
* [ ] Update the `vsphere-config-secret` in the `kube-system` namespace.
* [ ] Update existing `MachineSet` objects. Note that when renaming the Datacenter, the `folder` and `resourcePool` parameters usually must be changed as well.
* [ ] Update existing `Machine` objects. Otherwise the Machine API operator won't be able to find the VMs again.
* [ ] Update existing `Machine` objects not belonging to a `MachineSet`, for example master systems.
