= Common annotations

== Kubernetes resource annotations

We currently don't define any standard annotations for Kubernetes resources.

== Alert annotations

We use a few standard annotations for alerts on OpenShift 4.
Currently the following annotations have a well-defined meaning.

[NOTE]
====
There's currently no well-defined annotation for the alert summary and description.
This is mostly due to the fact that we use alert rules from different third parties which don't all use the same conventions.
