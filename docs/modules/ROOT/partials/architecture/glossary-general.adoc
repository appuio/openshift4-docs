|Pod network
a|A subnet that's internal to the Openshift 4 cluster.

|Service network
a|A subnet that's internal to the OpenShift 4 cluster.
This subnet shouldn't be routable from outside the cluster.

This subnet is managed by Cilium and is implemented with eBPF rules on the cluster VMs.

APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 uses `172.30.0.0/16` as the service network.
If the service network IP range conflicts with existing subnets, the service network IP range can be adjusted.
| VSHN / Cilium

|DNS
a|The APPUiO Managed OpenShift 4 cluster's base DNS records are defined and managed by VSHN.
